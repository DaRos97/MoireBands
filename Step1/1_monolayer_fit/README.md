# Monolayer fit

We fit the monolayer usind the eleven-band model of *PHYSICAL REVIEW B 92, 205108 (2015)* and minimizing with a chi2 procedure wrt experimental data of monolayers.

We have cuts going on KGC and KMC for WSe2 and WS2. 

We fit starting with the DFT parameters and we want to stay more opr less close to it since the bands are just essentially cosines and there are ~40 free parameters.

We keep the SO coupling as the DFT one, no minimization for it.
