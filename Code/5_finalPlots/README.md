# Plots

## Figure 1
Here we plot the bilayer with interlayer coupling WITHOUT the moirè potential from Gamma to K.

We also look at the orbital character:
    - There are 44 orbitals: 22 top and 22 bottom
    - If we only consider the top band orbitals we get a contribution of the WS2 which is only relevant close to Gamma since the interlayer acts only here.
    - If consider all of them the bands at K need to be shadowed somehow.
