#Copy from yggdrasil
- ygg.sh
Copies both temp/ and resutls/ from yggdrasil to local.

#Plot
- Plot_final.py
Here can decide to plot either temp/ or results/ fit parameters.

#DFT distance
- distance_dft.py
Computes a table with difference of resulting pars from DFT ones, with percentage.
Also here can decide which result to use for the table.

#Copy to step 2
- copy_res.py
Copies the result to inputs of step 2. Chose inside what result to copy.


#Computations
##Ygg:
    Computing with range 0.1 to 1.0, WSe2 and WS2, on both cuts and also just on KGK
