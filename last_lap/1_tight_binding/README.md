#Compute files
- tight_binding.py
- functions.py
- parameters.py

#Copy from yggdrasil
- ygg.sh
Copies both temp/ and resutls/ from yggdrasil to local.

#Plot
- Plot_final.py
Here can decide to plot either temp/ or results/ fit parameters.

#DFT distance
- distance_dft.py
Computes a table with difference of resulting pars from DFT ones, with percentage.
Also here can decide which result to use for the table.

#Orbital content
- orbital_content.py
Computes the relevant orbital content close to Gamma and K.

#Computations
##Ygg:
    - Computing with range 0.1 to 1.0, WSe2 and WS2, on both cuts and also just on KGK --> DONE
##Bao
    - Computing same just for WS2 after adjusting offset
