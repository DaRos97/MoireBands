Here we compute the final CEM to compare to those of S11. The procedue is the same as for step 3
but the calculation is longer due to the fact that we need to evaluate a grid in k space instead
of a line. 
For this step we use some specific prameters derived in step 3, in particular the Moire ones: 
(V,phi) at gamma and K.

# Code
get_1_2_3.py    imports the parameters from previopus steps
cem.py & functions.py       compute the cem
