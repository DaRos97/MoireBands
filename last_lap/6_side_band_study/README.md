Compare side bands distances:

There are many steps to make a good comparison:
- with `1_cut_image.py` we refine S3 and S11
- with `2_mass.py` we fit the WSe2 with a parabula to get the mass and the offset
- with `3_distance.py` we compute the side band distances
- with `4_side_bands.py` we finaly compare analytic, numeric and experimental result
